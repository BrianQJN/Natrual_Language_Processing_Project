You dislike the fact that your health is slowly deteriorating after each cigarette.,0,"First, I will try to analyze this sentence to see if it is non-confrontational. The language used here seems somewhat accusatory, stating that the individual dislikes the fact that their health is deteriorating due to smoking. This statement does not avoid confrontation and may in fact provoke defensive reactions from the listener. 

Secondly, the statement does not encourage self-exploration or use invitational language. It does not pose any open-ended questions or provide any opportunities for the listener to explore their thoughts, feelings, or experiences. 

Thirdly, the statement seems to lack empathy and understanding. It instead appears to be making assumptions about the listener's feelings and experiences without showing empathy toward them, which can be considered judgmental. 

Fourthly, the statement is rather assertive than tentative. It states as a fact that the listener's health is deteriorating due to smoking, and introduces this as a fact that the listener dislikes. 

Fifthly, this statement does not promote the listener's autonomy. It does not offer any options or suggest that the listener has the power to make their own decisions. 

Lastly, the statement does not respect the listener's expertise about their own life. Instead, it assumes that the listener dislikes the fact that their health is deteriorating due to smoking, without asking for their views or experiences. 

Having gone through the analysis, I conclude that the statement is 'Not Soft'."
How do you feel about the impact of your smoking habits on your health?,1,"To determine whether the statement is 'soft' or 'not soft', I will analyze it based on the distinct criteria per your request.

1. Non-confrontational: The question does not accuse or attack the listener directly about their smoking habit. Instead, it asks about the person's feelings, thus it is non-confrontational.

2. Encourages self-exploration and invitational language: The statement invites the listener to reflect on their personal experiences and the impact of their smoking habits on their health, hence promoting self-exploration.

3. Shows empathy and understanding: Since the statement is directed at the listener's feelings, it demonstrates a sense of empathy and understanding.

4. Tentative in its assertions: The question makes no firm assertions or conclusions about the listener's smoking habit or health. It merely queries their opinion, which indicates tentativeness.

5. Promotes the listener's autonomy: The listener is given the autonomy and freedom to express their perspective on how their smoking habits impact their health, thus the statement promotes the listener's autonomy.

6. Respects the listener’s expertise about their own life: By asking the listener how they feel about their situation, the statement respects the listener's expertise on their own life. 

From this analysis, this statement is delicate in its approach. Therefore, it is a 'Soft' statement."
You were in a lot of pain.,0,"To determine whether this statement is 'Soft' or 'Not Soft', I will consider the criteria for softness and see if the statement aligns with them. Let’s break it down:

1. Non-confrontational - The statement is non-confrontational as it is not arguing or challenging the listener. It's merely observing the listener's past condition. 

2. Encourage self-exploration & invitational language - The statement doesn't necessarily facilitate self-exploration or use invitational language. It reports on a past reality but doesn't particularly invite the listener to further discuss or explore their experience.

3. Show empathy and understanding - The statement does show a level of understanding about the listener’s situation, but doesn’t explicitly convey empathy.

4. Tentative in its assertions - The statement is direct and assertive, implying a confirmed fact rather than suggesting a possibility, which isn’t being tentative.

5. Promote the listener’s autonomy and respect the listener’s expertise about their own life – The statement doesn’t infringe on the listener’s autonomy, nor does it disrespect their expertise, but it doesn’t actively promote or respect these either. It simply states an observation.

So, based on reviewing the statement against the criteria, the statement meets some but not all of the criteria of 'Soft'. It doesn't facilitate self-reflection or use soft invitational language, and it's not tentative in its assertions.

Therefore, I would label this statement as 'Not Soft'."
How do you believe your experiences of pain have influenced your habits?,1,"I start by noting that this statement is non-confrontational, as it doesn't accuse or insult the listener but instead focuses on the listener's experiences and habits. It encourages self-exploration by asking the listener to examine how their experiences, specifically of pain, have affected their habits, inviting reflection on their personal experiences and internal states. The statement uses invitational language (""How do you believe...?"") to spark this exploration, giving the listener power to share or not share as they see fit.

Notably, the statement doesn't make assumptions about the listener's experiences; it's tentative in its assertions, recognizing that the speaker doesn't have all of the answers. This tentativeness implies a level of empathy and understanding from the speaker, acknowledging that the listener's experiences are theirs alone, as are their choices and habits. 

Moreover, the question respects the listener's autonomy as well as their expertise about their own life; it assumes that the listener is the one who knows best in regards to their personal experiences and habits. It leaves them with the freedom to pinpoint how their experiences have affected their habits, as per their understanding.

Considering all these factors, I would label this statement as 'Soft'."
You enjoy the calming effect nicotine gives you.,0,"To determine if this statement is 'Soft' or 'Not Soft', I'll start by examining whether or not it fulfills the criteria provided.

1. Non-confrontational: The statement isn't attacking or blaming the listener in any way. It's merely making a suggestion about their behavior, which is non-confrontational. 

2. Encourage self-exploration with invitational language: The statement is not inviting the listener to explore their feelings or thoughts. It makes an assertion and does not necessarily invite discussion or reflection about it.

3. Show empathy and understanding: Although the statement seems to understand that the listener enjoys the calming effect of nicotine, this understanding seems superficial as it does not explore the deeper reasons behind this enjoyment. 

4. Be tentative in its assertions: The sentence doesn't show tentativeness. It definitively states a person enjoys nicotine's calming effect, which does not account for the possibility of them having different experiences or feelings about it.

5. Promote the listener's autonomy: The sentence doesn't seem to encourage the listener's independence in decision making or opinions. 

6. Respect the listener's expertise about their own life: This statement might not respect the listener's life experience because it presumes a positive outcome (calming effect) from using nicotine.

So based on this analysis, the statement does not fulfill all the criteria for being a 'Soft' statement. It lacks invitational language, empathy, tentative assertions, promotion of autonomy, and the respect of the listener's own life expertise. 

Therefore, this statement is 'Not Soft'."
How does the calming effect of nicotine influence your feelings towards it?,1,"To analyze this statement based on the criteria for softness, we need to look at its different aspects.

Firstly, the statement is non-confrontational. It isn't aggressively challenging the listener or making any kind of direct criticism or accusation. Thus, it checks the first box for a 'Soft' statement.

Secondly, it encourages self-exploration and uses an invitational language. By asking ""How does the calming effect of nicotine influence your feelings towards it?"", this statement is inviting the listener to explore their own feelings and experiences with nicotine, therefore it aligns with the second criteria for softness.

Another criteria this statement fulfills is showing empathy and understanding. In recognizing that nicotine has a calming effect, the statement is showing an understanding of the listener's situation.

This statement is also tentative in its assertions, not presuming to know or define the listener's relationship to nicotine. Rather, it leaves room for the listener to provide their own interpretation of their feelings towards it.

As for the listener's autonomy, the statement respects it by allowing the listener to define their own feelings towards nicotine. It does not preemptively impose any feelings or viewpoints on the listener.

Finally, the statement respects the listener's expertise about their own life. It assumes that they are the best person to explain their feelings and experiences with nicotine.

In conclusion, this statement fulfills all the softness criteria required: it's non-confrontational, encourages self-exploration with invitational language, shows empathy and understanding, is tentative in its assertions, promotes the listener's autonomy, and respects the listener's expertise about their own life. So, this statement is 'Soft'."
You use amphetamines too often.,0,"To determine if the statement is 'Soft' or 'Not Soft', I first see that there is no element of empathy or understanding portrayed in the statement. It is a direct assertion, with a confrontational tone indicating that the person uses amphetamines too often. It is not opening a discussion, providing room for self-exploration, or giving the listener autonomy. It is telling them directly about their behavior without considering their own expertise about their own life. Therefore, this is a strong assertion rather than a tentative one and it doesn't respect the listener's autonomy. It does not encourage self-exploration. It seems to be a pointed judgment rather than an observation or open-ended dialogue. 

In conclusion, the statement 'You use amphetamines too often' is 'Not Soft'."
How do you feel about your current frequency of amphetamine use?,1,"To determine if the statement ""How do you feel about your current frequency of amphetamine use?"" is soft or not soft, we must analyze it according to the provided criteria.

Firstly, the statement is non-confrontational as it is not directly attacking or criticizing the listener's amphetamine use. It is also encouraging self-exploration by asking the listener how they feel about their use, prompting them to reflect on the matter. This directly ties in with showing empathy and understanding, as asking the question demonstrates a willingness to listen and understand rather than outright judging and criticizing.

The statement is tentative in its assertions in that it doesn't come across as imposing a definite belief or direction for the conversation. Instead, the question is open-ended and leaves room for the listener's unique response.

Regarding promoting the listener's autonomy, the question does this well. It provides space for the listener to express their thoughts and feelings rather than being told what they should think or do.

Lastly, the statement respects the listener's expertise about their own life. It acknowledges that the listener is the most informed person about their experiences and feelings, and hence, their input is essential.

Based on this analysis, the statement is 'Soft'."
You dislike how cigarette smoke smells.,0,"To determine if this statement is 'soft' or 'not soft', I'd consider its characteristics as per the definition of softness. 

Firstly, this sentence is not invitational, it doesn’t encourage any self-exploration or conversation; the listener has no space to interpret or provide their perspective. 

Secondly, it lacks empathy and understanding. It's making an assumption about the listener's preferences; it doesn't seek to understand the listener's viewpoint or experiences related to the smell of cigarette smoke. 

Next, it's not tentative in its assertion; it's definitive and presumes the listener's feelings. 

The statement also does not promote the listener's autonomy nor respects their expertise about their own life. It comes across as a statement made on behalf of the listener, reducing their autonomy and dismissing their personal experience or feelings.

Based on these points, this statement is 'Not Soft'."
How does the smell of cigarette smoke make you feel?,1,"First, I examine whether the statement is non-confrontational. The question ""How does the smell of cigarette smoke make you feel?"" is clearly non-aggressive and does not introduce any conflict. Therefore, it is non-confrontational.

Next, I determine whether it encourages self-exploration with invitational language. The statement asks the listener ""how"" they feel about a specific situation, inviting them to explore and express their personal feelings, so it meets this criteria. 

Now, for empathy and understanding: this is more challenging because empathy is generally demonstrated in responses rather than questions. However, the fact that the person is asking about the listener's feelings suggests a desire to understand them, which indicates empathy.

The question is also tentative in its assertions. It is not making any claims or assumptions, it is simply asking for the listener's personal feelings. Furthermore, it is promoting the listener's autonomy. The question is about the listener's feelings and experiences, giving them the power to define their experience. 

Finally, does it respect the listener's expertise about their own life? As it's asking the listener to reflect on their feelings, it indeed acknowledges that the listener is the best judge of their own experiences and emotions. Therefore, this statement fulfills all the criteria for a 'Soft' statement. It is non-confrontational, encourages self-exploration, shows empathy, is tentative, promotes autonomy, and respects the listener's expertise about their own life.

Conclusion: 'Soft'"
You dislike the fact that your health is slowly deteriorating after each cigarette.,0,"To analyze this statement, let's take the criteria one by one. 

1. Non-confrontational: The statement can appear to be confrontational as it points out a negative consequence of the listener's behavior. It directly calls out the listener's unfavorable health condition. 

2. Encourages self-exploration with invitational language: The statement isn't really inviting the person to explore their feelings or thoughts about their health or smoking behavior. It just states an assumed fact.

3. Shows empathy and understanding: While the statement does show concern about the listener's health, it does not necessarily echo empathy or active understanding. 

4. Tentative in its assertions: The statement is direct and assertive by saying ""You dislike"" rather than showing hesitance or suggesting a possibility that the listener might feel this way. 

5. Promote the listener's autonomy: Instead of promoting autonomy, the statement makes an assumption about what the listener dislikes without leaving room for the listener’s own perception or feelings.

6. Respect the listener's expertise about their own life: It presumes a certain attitude towards health deterioration from the person. The listener may or may not dislike what is happening without having the opportunity to explain.

After evaluating the statement on these criteria, it seems the message does not meet the requirements to be considered a 'soft' statement. The statement comes across as confrontational, lacks empathy and understanding, is assertive, and doesn't respect the listener's expertise about their own life or promote their autonomy.

Judgement: Not Soft"
How do you feel about the impact of your smoking habits on your health?,1,"This statement seems to meet the criteria for softness. First, it is non-confrontational - it does not criticize the listener's smoking habits directly, but rather puts the impact of these habits in question, leaving the listener to share their feelings about it. Second, it encourages self-exploration as it invites the listener to reflect on the effects of their actions. Third, it shows empathy and understanding as it is concerned about the listener's health. Fourth, it remains tentative by not making any assertions or assumptions about what the listener should feel. Fifth, it respects the listener's autonomy, not telling them what they should do, but finding out how they feel about their situation. Finally, it presumes the listener has expertise about their life, asking about their feelings on their habits' impact on their health, something only they would know. So, this is a 'Soft' statement."
You were in a lot of pain.,0,"To determine if this statement is 'soft' or 'not soft', we'll need to examine it based on the given criteria for softness. 

Firstly, the statement is non-confrontational. It's stating a fact or an observation, not initiating a conflict. 

Secondly, it's difficult to say whether this statement encourages self-exploration with invitational language, as it's quite a simple, declarative sentence. However, it doesn't seem to discourage self-exploration either. It might lead the listener to reflect on the pain they were in, depending on the context.

Next, the statement does seem to show empathy and understanding by recognizing that the person was in pain. It acknowledges their experience.

However, the statement isn't tentative in its assertions. It makes a clear, definitive statement: ""You were in a lot of pain.""

Then, the statement doesn't particularly promote the listener's autonomy, as it doesn't leave much room for the listener's input or interpretation of their experience.

Lastly, by stating the listener was in a lot of pain, this does respect their expertise about their own life and experiences.

In conclusion, while this statement meets some of the criteria for softness, it doesn't meet all of them. It is non-confrontational and shows empathy and understanding. However, it doesn't encourage self-exploration with invitational language, it isn't tentative, and it doesn't particularly promote the listener's autonomy. 

So, this statement is 'Not Soft'."
How do you believe your experiences of pain have influenced your habits?,1,"To determine if this statement is soft, we can follow these steps:

1. Non-confrontational: The tone of the statement is not aggressive, belittling, or blaming. It is neutral, implying that there's no right or wrong response.
2. Encourages Self-Exploration: The statement asks the listener to introspectively consider the influence of their personal experiences on their behavior, promoting self-understanding.
3. Uses Invitational Language: The statement uses the phrase ""how do you believe"", which indicate the speaker isn't insisting on any stance, rather inviting the listener to share their views.
4. Shows Empathy and Understanding: This is somewhat tentative as it entirely depends upon the listener's interpretation. Regardless, if at a surface level, it implicitly acknowledges the listener's past experiences of pain, showing an understanding of their potential significant impacts.
5. Tentative Assertions: The sentence is structured not as a statement, but as a question where the respondent can choose the level of depth to their response.
6. Promotes Autonomy: The listener is free to decide how to address this question, which shows autonomy.
7. Respects Listener’s Expertise: The speaker poses a question about the listener's life, demonstrating respect for their personal experiences and their judgments around them, acknowledging that the listener is the expert in their own life.

Upon considering all these factors, it seems reasonable to conclude that this statement is 'Soft'."
You enjoy the calming effect nicotine gives you.,0,"To evaluate if this statement is 'Soft' or 'Not Soft', one can examine it based on several criteria. These criteria comprise being non-confrontational, promoting self-exploration, exhibiting empathy and understanding, being tentative, promoting the listener's sovereignty, and respecting the listener's insights about their life.

The statement, ""You enjoy the calming effect nicotine gives you,"" appears non-confrontational, as it does not challenge or criticize the listener. 

However, it is somewhat affirmative in its assumptions rather than tentative. It assumes that the listener enjoys the calming effect of nicotine without giving them the freedom to affirm or debate this point. Ideally, a more tentative approach would ask the listener about their personal experiences with nicotine.

This statement does not seem to promote self-exploration or show empathy. It assumes a fact about the listener, which takes away from their autonomy to express and explore their own feelings and thoughts.

Although the statement acknowledges a supposed fact about the listener's life, it is stated as a truth, not respecting the listener's expertise or unique personal experience. 

In conclusion, despite being non-confrontational, the statement does not fulfill most criteria of being soft. Therefore, it is 'Not Soft'."
How does the calming effect of nicotine influence your feelings towards it?,1,"Let's break down the given statement according to the softness criteria and examine each part:

1. Non-confrontational: This statement does not appear to be confronting the listener as it's asking about their feelings towards nicotine's calming effect. It's not forcing or asserting any idea but rather trying to gain insight into their perspective. So, it meets the non-confrontational criterion.

2. Encourages self-exploration: Definitely, the question encourages the listener to reflect on their own experiences and feelings towards nicotine. It's promoting a deeper understanding of their attitudes towards their use of nicotine. So, it also meets this criterion.

3. Shows empathy and understanding: The statement doesn't directly show empathy, but by allowing the listener to express their feelings about nicotine's calming effect, it tends the listener to feel understood and heard, which indirectly shows empathy. Hence, it also satisfies this criterion.

4. Is tentative in its assertions: Since it's a question and isn't assertive on any point, it is tentative and encourages open conversation rather than asserting any idea.

5. Promotes the listener's autonomy: Indeed, by asking the listener for their feelings, the statement respects and promotes the listener's autonomy to express their views. 

6. Respects the listener's expertise about their own life: The statement acknowledges that the listener knows their feelings best and respects their expertise in this regard.

Conclusively, considering all points, the statement is indeed 'Soft'."
You use amphetamines too often.,0,"First, I'll examine the wording of the statement. Here, it's assertive and directly confrontational, making a judgement on the listener's behavior. Specifically, the use of the word ""too"" is a clear judgement that the person is using amphetamines too often, according to the speaker. 

Second, I'll evaluate whether or not the statement encourages self-exploration, invitational language, shows empathy and understanding. This statement does not encourage or open up space for self-exploration or self-reflection; rather, it asserts a definitive belief or judgement, shutting down the potential for dialogue.

Third, I'll check whether the statement promotes the listener's autonomy. This statement does not seem to respect that, as it imposes a judgment without asking for the listener’s view or feelings. 

Lastly, I'll observe whether the statement respects the listener's expertise about their own life. This statement contradicts this criterion because it presumes to know what's best for the listener without acknowledging their understanding of their own experiences.

Given these observations, I can conclude that this statement is not soft."
How do you feel about your current frequency of amphetamine use?,1,"This statement begins by addressing a direct question to the listener which prompts them to think and express their feelings about a particular issue - their current frequency of amphetamine use. It's not positioned in a confrontational way, leaving room for open-end responses that could lead to further discussion or self-exploration. The use of ""how do you feel"" discounts any imposing attitude and leaves the interpretation and evaluation of the situation up to the listener, respecting their autonomy and personal expertise. 

However, a question about drug use might be seen as sensitive to some, and the directness with which it is posed, even though non-judgmental, might be considered invasive and confronting by some listeners. This varies greatly based on context and the relationship between speaker and listener. 

In summary, this statement in its essence appears to satisfy most of the features required of a 'Soft' statement - it's not confrontational, it encourages self-exploration, it uses invitational language, it respects the listener's personal wisdom, and promotes their autonomy. Therefore, based on the criteria provided, I would judge this statement as 'Soft'."
You dislike how cigarette smoke smells.,0,"To decide whether this is a 'Soft' statement or a 'Not Soft' statement, I'll keep all the criteria for the 'Soft' statement in focus.

First, this statement is certainly non-confrontational as it doesn't engage or provoke the listener in any form of dispute or conflict, it simply states an opinion.

Second, it doesn't necessarily encourage self-exploration. It's more of a factual declaration about someone's preferences rather than inviting someone to understand themselves better through exploring their preferences. So, it doesn't use invitational language.

Third, the statement doesn't demonstrate empathy or understanding. It is simply stating a preference without showing that the speaker understands or shares the feelings of the listener.

Fourth, the statement is quite definitive and lacking tentativeness. It presents a firm opinion, rather than a flexible, open-ended perspective that invites feedback.

Fifth, it doesn't particularly promote listener's autonomy nor does it acknowledge the listener's expertise about their own life. The statement just gives an opinion about one's preference without taking into account the listener's perspective.

Based on this analysis, it becomes clear that the statement fails to meet the criteria for a 'Soft' statement. Thus, I conclude that it is a 'Not Soft' statement."
How does the smell of cigarette smoke make you feel?,1,"To decide the nature of this statement, let's carefully examine its components.

1. Non-confrontational: The statement is not aggressive or confrontational. It does not express any personal opinions about cigarette smoke, instead it invites the listener to share their thoughts and feelings.

2. Encourage self-exploration with invitational language: The statement is open-ended, rather than leading the listener towards a predetermined answer. It encourages the listener to think about their own reactions to cigarette smoke. 

3. Show empathy and understanding: The way the sentence is phrased indicates understanding that the smell of cigarette smoke might evoke different feelings in each individual.

4. Be tentative in its assertions: The statement does not assert anything and is waiting for responses from the listener solely based on their perspective and feelings.

5. Promote the listener's autonomy: The statement clearly respects and values the listener's feelings and perspectives, giving them full autonomy to express themselves.

6. Respect the listener's expertise about their own life: The way the question is phrased respects the listener's knowledge and experience of their own life, as it asks about their personal response to a common experience.

Therefore, based on the criteria for softness, this statement can be considered 'Soft'."
"You're here to talk about your gambling, is that right?",0,"To determine whether this statement is 'soft' or 'not soft', I'll walk through the criteria step-by-step.

1. Non-confrontational: The statement doesn't accuse or blame, it's just trying to verify a subject matter. Therefore, it's non-confrontational.
2. Encourage self-exploration with invitational language: The statement is not explicitly inviting the listener to share or explore their feelings or experience, but it's trying to initiate a conversation which could eventually lead there.
3. Show empathy and understanding: This is somewhat neutral in this category. There isn't any language used that expressly shows empathy or understanding, but similarly, the language doesn't demonstrate a lack of empathy or understanding either.
4. Be tentative in its assertions: The statement is indeed tentative - it poses a question rather than assuming.
5. Promote the listener's autonomy: By asking the listener to verify the topic, the statement acknowledges the listener's autonomy in determining what is to be discussed.
6. Respect the listener's expertise about their own life: The statement does not make assumptions about the listener's experiences or feelings, thereby respecting the listener's expertise about their own life.

Though it does not fully meet all the criteria, it does meet a majority of them. Thus, I judge this statement to be 'Soft'."
Could we explore your thoughts and feelings about your gaming activities?,1,"Firstly, this statement is not confrontational as it's asking for permission to start a discussion about an individual's gaming activities. Secondly, it encourages self-exploration through invitational language, specifically the use of the word 'could' and asking to explore thoughts and feelings. Displaying empathy and understanding is difficult to directly notice, but asking about someone's feelings inherently shows some level of empathy. The question is tentative and not making assertions about the person’s gaming habits. It's respectful to the listener's expertise about their own life by asking them to share their thoughts and feelings, providing autonomy in the conversation. Therefore, I would conclude this is a 'Soft' statement."
You realize that by making this change you will have a big impact on your life and you are looking forward to how it will look.,0,"First, let me take apart the statement, ""You realize that by making this change you will have a big impact on your life and you are looking forward to how it will look.""

This statement is non-confrontational. It doesn't challenge or fight against the listener's beliefs or actions - it's simply presenting an observation or a future-oriented perspective about the listener's situation or decision. 

It encourages self-exploration with invitational language like 'realize' and 'looking forward', implying that the speaker is inviting the listener to think about or envisage their future after making the said change. 

The phrase 'you will have a big impact on your life', implies empathy and understanding; it acknowledges the fact that making changes can have significant effects in one's life and it's a big decision to do so.

Rather than being assertive or definitive, it's tentative. It doesn't say 'you must do this' or 'you should do this,' it simply helps the listener to imagine the potential outcomes or consequences of making the change.

Moreover, it certainly respects the listener's autonomy and expertise about their own life. When the speaker says 'you realize' it indicates that the listener inherently knows and understands their personal circumstances and is capable of making their own decisions.

From this analysis, it is clear that this statement fits all the criteria outlined for a 'Soft' statement. Therefore, it is 'Soft'."
"How do you envision the impact this change could potentially have on your life, and what are you most looking forward to about it?",1,"To decide if this statement is soft, I'd consider the following:

1. Is it non-confrontational? Check. The statement is not challenging or aggressive. It's asking the listener to ponder the consequences of a change in their life, which is a calm and neutral topic.

2. Does it encourage self-exploration with invitational language? Check. The question ""How do you envision..."" invites the listener to think deeply about their future and expectations.

3. Does it show empathy and understanding? Check. The statement acknowledges that a change can have a profound impact on a person's life.

4. Is it tentative in its assertions? Check. The use of ""potentially"" makes the question more open-ended, and less of an assertion.

5. Does it promote the listener's autonomy? Check. The listener is being asked about their own life and perspective, which gives them agency.

6. Does it respect the listener's expertise about their own life? Check. The question acknowledges that the person is the best expert of their own life and what they're looking forward to.

Given all these, the statement is 'Soft'."
You are concerned with the costs of smoking.,0,"To determine whether this statement is soft or not, let's break it down based on the criteria for softness. 

1. Non-confrontational: The statement ""You are concerned with the costs of smoking"" doesn't confront or challenge the listener in any offensive way. It's simply making a statement about their probable concern over the costs of smoking. So, on this criterion, the statement fits the 'Soft' description.

2. Encourage self-exploration: The statement could potentially lead the listener to consider their own feelings about the cost of smoking, thereby encouraging a degree of self-reflection or exploration. It's a bit of a stretch, but this tends to fit the 'Soft' criteria to some extent. 

3. Show empathy and understanding: The statement assumes knowledge of the listener's concern. Whether or not it accurately reflects the listener's feelings can show an attempt at empathy and understanding. Depending on the context, it could either display empathy or oversimplification of the listener's stance. 

4. Tentative in its assertions: The statement is fairly assertive. It leaves no room for the possibility that the listener may not be particularly concerned with the cost of smoking, so it does not fit this 'Soft' criterion.

5. Promote the listener's autonomy: The statement does not promote or restrict the listener's autonomy; it is simply making an observation about their concern. It is not applicable for this criterion. 

6. Respect the listener's expertise about their own life: Making a statement about the listener's concern without querying about it can come across as assumptive rather than respectful of the listener's knowledge of their own feelings and thoughts, so it does not fit this 'Soft' criterion.

In conclusion, the statement ""You are concerned with the costs of smoking"" is somewhat non-confrontational and potentially encourages self-exploration. However, it doesn't meet all the criteria sufficiently, such as being tentative and respecting the listener's expertise about their own life. Therefore, based on the softness criteria, this statement can be categorized as 'Not Soft'."
How do you feel about the financial implications of your smoking habit?,1,"First, I'd evaluate if the statement is non-confrontational. This statement is not directly criticizing the listener's smoking habit, but is instead opening a dialogue about the financial implications of it. Secondly, it encourages self-exploration because it is an open-ended question that is encouraging the listener to reflect on their own smoking habit. 

Next, the statement's language is invitatory. The word 'how' indeed invites the listener to share their feelings on the given matter. Additionally, the statement demonstrates empathy and understanding because it is not directly confronting the listener about their habit but instead discussing the financial implications, demonstrating an understanding that there maybe other aspects to consider other than health.

As for being tentative in assertions, the question suggests no presumptions made by the person asking. There is no claim or assertion being made about the listener's feelings. The listener is also encouraged to be autonomous here because they have the control over what they can answer. 

Lastly, the statement respects the listener's expertise about their own life by inviting them to share their thoughts on their smoking habit, acknowledging that they are the best judge of how it affects them financially. 

Based on these observations, the statement can be classified as 'Soft' as it meets all the criteria for a soft statement."
"You believe that by making changes to your smoking habit, you can improve your health.",0,"Starting with the first part of the statement, ""You believe..."" this phrase respects the listener's autonomy--it doesn't force them to accept someone else's beliefs. The second part, ""that by making changes to your smoking habit,"" is the potential area of contention, and it sets the stage for self-exploration. The speaker recognizes that the listener has a smoking habit but does not outright demand they quit, it's more about making changes which could range from reducing the frequency to total cessation. Lastly, ""you can improve your health"" is a positive, supportive statement that shows that the speaker cares about the listener's well-being. The statement does not confront, challenges or disregards the listener in any way, and it also encourages the listener to do some self-exploration regarding their smoking habit.

So, based on these observations, this could be considered a 'soft' statement, because it meets the criteria of non-confrontational, encourages self-exploration, shows empathy, promotes autonomy and respect towards the listener's experience. 

Judgment: Soft."
Have you ever thought about how altering your smoking habits could have the potential to enhance your health?,1,"To determine whether this statement is 'soft' or 'not soft', I'm going to go through each of the criteria for softness. 

First, this statement is non-confrontational. It asks about the listener's thoughts on their smoking habits and potential health enhancement without directly criticizing their current smoking habits. 

Second, it encourages self-exploration. It invites the listener to think about how changing their smoking habits could potentially benefit their health. 

Third, it shows empathy and understanding. By saying 'have the potential to', it acknowledges that changing habits can have different effects for different individuals. 

Fourth, the statement is tentative in its assertions. Instead of making a hard statement that changing smoking habits will enhance health, it proposes this as a possibility to be considered. 

Fifth, it respects the listener's autonomy. It's asking if they've ever thought about this, not telling them what they should do. 

And finally, it respects the listener's expertise about their own life. It acknowledges that the listener knows their habits and health best. 

Since the statement meets all of these criteria, I conclude that this statement is 'Soft.'"
You realize that quitting smoking is important for your health and would like to make this happen without relying on cigarettes.,0,"First, I'm looking at the tone of the statement. It doesn't sound confrontational, aggressive, or judgmental. The sender is respectful towards the receiver's feelings and isn't trying to impose their own perspective. 

Next, I assess the statement's focus. It revolves around the listener's own understanding of the situation, which encourages self-exploration. The language used (""you realize"") shows that the speaker acknowledges the listener's own assessment of the situation and respects their autonomy and insights.

Then, I examine the language of the statement. It's tentative, using words such as ""realize"" and ""would like"" which are invitational and non-demanding. Moreover, the statement doesn't directly tell the listener what to do, but rather gently encourages positive actions for their health. 

Finally, it also manifests empathy and understanding, acknowledging the difficulty of quitting smoking and supporting the listener's attempt to do so. 

Based on these evaluations, I would conclude that the statement is 'Soft'."
"Have you thought about what it might look like for you to improve your health, such as exploring the possibility of not relying on cigarettes anymore?",1,"To determine if this statement is 'Soft', I consider the following aspects:

- Non-confrontational: The statement is not presented as a criticism or an attack. It's framed as a suggestion, indirectly asking the person if they have explored alternatives to cigarettes for their health. 

- Encourages self-exploration: By asking ""have you thought about..."", the statement is encouraging the person to reflect on their health and habits. It's not imposing a solution but asking them to discover it on their own.

- Using invitational language: The phrases ""Have you thought about"" and ""exploring the possibility,"" make this statement inviting and approachable. It's giving the person a chance to think about it, inviting them to consider possibilities they may not have thought of.

- Empathy and understanding: The statement shows empathy by taking into account how difficult it can be to stop relying on cigarettes. It's not directly saying 'stop smoking', but rather offering the idea of exploring other avenues for health improvement.

- Tentativeness: The statement is tentative, it doesn't make definitive or absolute claims.

- Promoting autonomy: By stating 'for you to improve your health' the speaker is allowing the listener the autonomy to make changes for their health.

- Respect the listener's expertise: The phrase 'what it might look like for you' acknowledges the listener's personal expertise. It reinforces that the listener knows their own circumstances better than anyone else.

In conclusion, based on the criteria set for a 'Soft' statement, this statement is 'Soft'."
You enjoy smoking because it helps you cope with stressful situations. ,0,"To evaluate this statement for softness, we need to examine its characteristics in relation to our criteria.

1. Non-confrontational: The statement isn't confrontational. It provides an observation or assumption about the listener's behavior without overtly criticizing it.
2. Encourages self-exploration with invitational language: It does not invite or encourage the person to explore their behavior or feelings further. It is making an assumption rather than asking a question.
3. Shows empathy and understanding: The statement does show some understanding of the reason someone might smoke, stating that it helps cope with stressful situations.
4. Is tentative in its assertions: The sentence isn't tentative. It is declaring a reason why the listener enjoys smoking, which may or may not be true.
5. Promotes listener's autonomy: The statement is not particularly promoting the listener's autonomy. It's not asking them to consider why they might smoke or alternatives to smoking.
6. Respects the listener's expertise about their own life: The assumption made in the statement may not respect the listener's personal understanding of their behavior.

Given these points, the statement doesn't meet all the criteria for softness. Even though it isn't confrontational and shows some understanding, it lacks invitation to self-exploration, promotion of autonomy, respect for listener's expertise on their life, and doesn't have a tentative tone. 

Judgement: Not Soft."
Have you ever considered what role smoking plays in helping you manage stressful situations?,1,"First, I would determine if the statement is non-confrontational. This statement poses a question in a gentle manner without any sign of judgment or harshness. Hence, it's non-confrontational. 

Second, it encourages self-exploration as it invites the listener to ponder on the role of smoking in their stress management. This could lead the listener to reflect on their patterns of behavior and their reliance on smoking. 

Third, this statement implies empathy and understanding by recognising and acknowledging that the individual may be facing stressful situations and may be using smoking as a coping mechanism.

Fourth, it is tentative in its assertion as it does not impose any opinion or assumption. Instead, it opens an avenue for the person to discuss their own perception. 

Fifth, this statement actively honours the autonomy of the listener by asking them to consider their own behaviors and beliefs. The use of ""have you ever considered"" puts the listener in the control spot. 

Lastly, respect for the listener's expertise on their own life is shown as the statement doesn’t dictate how the listener should feel or act, but rather inquires about their experience and outlook. 

Conclusively, based on these evaluations, the statement can be described as 'Soft'."
"You got mad at the way you were being treated, and so decided not to interact further.",0,"Firstly, I'd examine the tone of the statement. While it isn't confrontational, it strongly asserts an understanding or interpretation of the listener's feelings (""You got mad"") without inviting them to share or confirm this interpretation. This could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding, but it's also not entirely dispassionate. 

Next, I'd look for evidence of encouragement for self-exploration. This statement doesn't necessarily discourage self-exploration, but it also doesn't promote it, given it provides an interpretation rather than asking questions or inviting the listener to introspect. 

Thirdly, the statement seems to respect the listener's autonomy by mentioning their independent decision to cease interactions. It's acknowledging the listener's agency. 

Lastly, I'd consider if the statement respects the listener's expertise about their own life. The statement is a description of the listener's supposed feelings and actions. However, it proceeds with enough confidence that it may not respect the listener’s expertise about their own life. 

Given these observations, the statement does not meet enough of the criteria to be considered 'soft'. It lacks the invitational language, the tentativeness in its assertions, and does not actively promote the listener's autonomy or expertise about their own life. Therefore, my final judgment would be 'Not Soft'."
Have you ever felt that your reaction to pull away from interaction was a result of feeling treated unfairly?,1,"The first step I take is to break down the statement and identify its key characteristics. The sentence begins with ""Have you ever felt,"" which is a gentle, invitational phrase that encourages self-exploration. This is non-confrontational as it gives the recipient the chance to engage with the statement at their own discretion. 

Next, the statement progresses into ""that your reaction to pull away from interaction was a result of feeling treated unfairly?"" This offers the listener an opportunity to reflect on their experiences and draw on their personal understanding of their life experiences. It prompts the listener to explore their feelings, which encourages insight and understanding. 

Moreover, this statement shows empathy as it suggests an understanding of possible scenarios where the listener might have felt slighted or treated unfairly, leading to a desire to withdraw from interaction. This phrase is also tentative in its assertions as it does not present any concrete assumptions or judgments. 

The statement respects the listener's autonomy and expertise about their own life by framing the listener's reaction as a possible response to unfair treatment, rather than insisting that the listener indeed felt this way.

Given these elements, this statement fulfills all the criteria specified for a 'soft' statement. Therefore, my judgment is that this statement is 'Soft'."
It would be a good idea for you to go through detoxification.,0,"In assessing this statement, let's look at it based on the softness criteria provided. 

1. Non-confrontational: This statement is somewhat confrontational as it directly suggests a specific action the listener should take. 

2. Encourage self-exploration with invitational language: There's no invitational language present in this statement. It does not invite the listener to ponder, explore or reflect on their feelings, thoughts, options or behaviours.

3. Show empathy and understanding: There's no explicit empathy or understanding conveyed here. It doesn't acknowledge the listener's feelings or challenges.

4. Tentative in its assertions: This statement isn't tentative. It straightforwardly states what the speaker deems is a good idea, without leaving room for doubt, guess or speculation.

5. Promote the listener's autonomy: The statement does not promote the listener's autonomy. It's rather directive, telling them what to do. 

6. Respect listener's expertise about their own life: The statement does not show respect for the listener's individual understanding of their situation. It seems to come from an external perspective, without acknowledging that the listener is the expert on their own life.

Based on this analysis, this statement does not meet the criteria to be considered 'Soft'. So, my judgement is: 'Not Soft'."
Have you ever considered what your experience might be like if you tried detoxification?,1,"To determine if this statement is 'Soft' or 'Not Soft', I will check it against the criteria for softness. The statement is non-confrontational, meaning it doesn't suggest any kind of conflict or criticism. It seems to encourage self-exploration by asking the listener to consider their own experience and what it might be like in a hypothetical situation. The use of an open question (""Have you ever considered..."") can be interpreted as invitational language, allowing the listener to engage in the conversation at their own comfort level. There is no assertion being made, so it indeed is tentative, merely posing a situation for the listener to contemplate. The question promotes the listener's autonomy by letting them evaluate and decide on their own. Lastly, the phrase respects the listener's expertise by giving them the opportunity to analyze their own potential experiences based on their knowledge of their life situation. Based on these factors, the statement would be categorized as 'Soft'."
You realize that cigarettes can potentially cause financial stress and you wish you could spend less on tobacco.,0,"First, I check if the statement is non-confrontational. In this case, the sentence does not challenge, argue, or oppose the listener in an aggressive manner. Instead, it gently brings in the topic of potentially reducing the expenditure on tobacco.

Next, it is important to verify if the statement encourages self-exploration with invitational language. Here, the use of phrases ""you realize"" and ""you wish"" encourages the listener to reflect on their own situation and feelings, thus encouraging self-exploration.

The next step is to see if the statement shows empathy and understanding. By putting the focus on what the listener might or should be experiencing (""realize"" and ""wish""), the statement shows understanding for their possible struggles.

We also need to determine if the statement is tentative in its assertions. In this case, the language used is not forceful or assertive; it doesn't tell the listener what to do but merely brings up potential risks and desires the listener might have.

Next, we assess whether the statement promotes the listener's autonomy. By stating ""you realize"" and ""you wish"", it places the responsibility and decision-making authority in the hands of the listener, supporting the autonomy principle. 

Lastly, the statement should respect the listener's expertise about their own life. By making it about the listener's realizations and wishes, not stating facts, it respects their understanding of their situation.

Given this analysis, the statement is 'Soft'."
Have you ever thought about how your finances might benefit if you reconsidered your tobacco use?,1,"Let's analyze this statement step by step.

1. Non-confrontational: The statement is raising a question instead of giving a direct confrontational statement. It seems to be more about opening a discussion rather than forcing a point of view. 

2. Encourage self-exploration with invitational language: The question posed encourages the listener to think about their tobacco usage in terms of its potential financial implications, possibly prompting introspection about their habits. ""Have you ever thought..."" is an invitation to reflect on their own life.

3. Show empathy and understanding: The statement does not explicitly show empathy and understanding, but by inquiring rather than assuming, it shows respect for the listener's situation and feelings of concern.

4. Be tentative in its assertions: The statement is tentative because it isn't assertive. It is phrased as a question, not a demand or a hard assertion.

5. Promote the listener's autonomy: By asking the listener to consider their choices, the statement encourages the listener to take control of their own actions and decisions.

6. Respect the listener's expertise about their own life: The statement acknowledges that the listener is the best judge of their life, by not expressly stating that tobacco use is bad for the listener’s finances.

Conclusively, based on this analysis, this statement can be classified as 'Soft'."
You dislike the health risks of smoking.,0,"To assess whether the statement is 'Soft' or 'Not Soft', I'll keep in mind our criteria.

1. Non-confrontational: The statement is not confrontational. It simply states an assumption that the listener dislikes the health risks of smoking. It doesn't provoke an argument or disagreement.

2. Encourage self-exploration with invitational language: The statement does not seem to lead the listener to explore their feelings or thoughts on the matter. It doesn't invite them to share their own perspective or engage in a deeper conversation about their views on smoking and its health risks.

3. Show empathy and understanding: The statement does not give any indication of empathy or understanding. It is more of a presumption about the listener's viewpoint – it doesn't show that the person making the statement understands or empathizes with how the listener feels about smoking's health risks.

4. Be tentative in its assertions: The statement is assertive, not tentative. It does not suggest the person making the statement is open to being corrected or hearing a different viewpoint.

5. Promote the listener's autonomy: The statement doesn't promote listener’s autonomy. It makes an assumption about the listener's opinion rather than asking or allowing them to share it themselves.

6. Respect the listener's expertise about their own life: The statement seems to override the listener's authority over their own experience. It doesn't invite the listener to share their own view. Instead, it assumes they dislike smoking's health risks.

Based on these observations, I would conclude this statement is 'Not Soft'."
How do you feel about the health risks associated with your smoking habits?,1,"This statement seems tentative as it invites the listener to share their feelings about their smoking habits. It does not sound confrontational but more of an invitation to express personal views. Moreover, it respects the listener's expertise about their own life and promotes their autonomy as the question doesn't impose anything but rather lets them explore their views. Lastly, it even shows an empathetic and understanding tone as the question acknowledges the presence of health risks.

After this analysis, it's clear that this statement is 'Soft'."
Quitting smoking will require you to find a way to distract yourself from the craving for cigarettes.,0,"The statement starts by acknowledging a challenge in quitting smoking and suggests a method to address it by finding distractions from the craving for cigarettes. It does not come across as confrontational or judgmental, focusing more on managing the problem rather than forcing a solution. It also respects the listener's autonomy by subtly implying that they will need to find ways that work for them, hence acknowledging their expertise about their own life. However, there isn't any explicit empathy or understanding conveyed in the statement, nor does it directly encourage self-exploration. Additionally, the tone of the statement seems quite assertive, lacking the tentative language that is characteristic of a 'soft' statement. 

So, overall, while the statement has some elements of 'softness', it doesn't fully meet all the criteria for a 'Soft' statement. Thus, the judgement would be 'Not Soft'."
Have you thought about what strategies you might use to manage your cigarette cravings when you decide you're ready to quit smoking?,1,"This statement begins with an invitational question, ""Have you thought about..."", which gently encourages the person to think about their own personal strategies or solutions to the problem at hand: cigarette cravings. It doesn't confront or instruct the person on what they should do. Instead, it affirms their autonomy, giving them the space to decide when they're ready to quit smoking, thus respecting their expertise about their own life. Additionally, it shows empathy and understanding for their situation by acknowledging that they will have cravings during the process. It's also tentative in its assertions, not imposing but rather suggesting the need to manage cravings. Finally, it subtly encourages self-exploration, as it promotes the individual to think about what methods would work best for them. Thus, based on all these factors, I would conclude that this is a 'Soft' statement."
It reminds you of your heart attack.,0,"For assessing the statement ""It reminds you of your heart attack,"" I'll consider following criteria: 

Is it non-confrontational? Yes, the statement doesn’t seem to be confronting, blaming, or criticizing the listener.

Does it encourage self-exploration with invitational language? No, as it seems to be stating a fact rather than inviting the listener to explore their own feelings or perceptions.

Does it show empathy and understanding? No, it appears to be a neutral statement perhaps intended to highlight the implications of specific actions or situations.

Is it tentative in its assertions? No, it’s presented as a firm observation, not a conjecture or assumption which may need further exploration.

Does it promote the listener's autonomy? No, there are no choices, freedom or control offered to the listener by this statement. In other words, it is not promoting the listener to make their own decisions.

Does it respect the listener's expertise about their own life? No, this statement seems to be made from the speaker’s perspective, not acknowledging the listener's personal experience or knowledge.

Based on these considerations, this statement is 'Not Soft'."
How does this experience relate to your feelings or thoughts about your past heart attack?,1,"Firstly, I evaluate the statement to see if it is non-confrontational. In this case, the question is posed in a considerate manner, not accusatory or aggressive, meaning it is non-confrontational. 

Next, I consider if it promotes self-exploration. The query encourages the listener to think deeply about their feelings and thoughts, in relation to a past experience, which means it promotes self-exploration.

Then, I determine if empathy and understanding are shown in the statement. This is slightly more challenging for this statement because it is a question. However, by asking about the person's feelings, it suggests a level of empathy and desire to understand their experience. 

After this, I assess whether the statement is tentative in its assertions. As a question, it isn't making any assertions, but rather seeking to understand the listener's perspective. 

Next, I looking into whether the question promotes the listener's autonomy. The listener is definitely given the freedom to express their feelings, thoughts, and perceptions without being steered towards a specific response, so it does promote the listener's autonomy.

Lastly, I determine whether the statement respects the listener's expertise about their own life. The asker is indeed seeking the listener's personal perspective, respecting their unique experience and expertise about their personal life and occurrences.

Therefore, after going through all the criteria, the statement ""How does this experience relate to your feelings or thoughts about your past heart attack?"" is considered 'Soft'."
Setting long-term plans for your smoking habit would help you quit.,0,"This statement requires evaluation based on several aspects:

1. Non-confrontational: It does not seem to confront or blame the listener. Instead, it provides helpful advice.
2. Self-exploration: The statement suggests a course of action (setting long-term plans), but it is general enough that the listener could engage in self-exploration regarding what this might mean for them.
3. Empathy and Understanding: The statement doesn't showcase strong empathy or understanding towards the listener's experience. It assumes the listener should quit smoking, but doesn't acknowledge how difficult this can be.
4. Tentative: The advice is delivered as a definitive statement rather than a suggestion. The use of ""would"" suggests a certainty that doesn't necessarily respect the listener's individual circumstances.
5. Autonomy: While the statement suggests a solution to quit smoking, it does not leave much space for the listener to decide how they want to proceed concerning their smoking habit, limiting their autonomy.
6. Listener's expertise: It assumes that long-term plans are the solution for quitting smoking, not taking into account the listener's past experiences or potential attempts to quit.

Given the statement, while not confrontational and includes an element of self-exploration by suggesting a course of action, it lacks empathy, tentativeness, respect for listener's autonomy and expertise about their life concerning their smoking habit.

Conclusion: Not Soft."
Have you ever considered creating a long-term plan for your smoking habit as a possible strategy for quitting?,1,"First, I'll determine if the statement is non-confrontational. In this case, the statement is posed as a non-accusing question, implying no judgement on part of the person asking. There's no confrontational tone or language used. 

Next, I'll see if the statement encourages self-exploration with invitational language. Here, the question ""Have you ever considered..."" encouraging the person to think about their smoking habit and potential solutions. This suggests self-exploration and the language is invitational.

Now, let's determine if the statement shows empathy and understanding. Empathy and understanding may not be directly stated but can be inferred from the respectful and non-judgmental tone. The statement recognizes the struggle of quitting smoking and offers a possible strategy, demonstrating an understanding.

The statement's tentativeness can be determined by how assertively it makes claims. Here, no absolute statements or direct advice are given. The strategy for quitting smoking is proposed as a possibility, making it tentative.

Next, I'll see if the statement promotes the listener's autonomy. The question form respects the listener's decision-making power and promotes their autonomy by asking them to consider a strategy rather than telling them what to do.

Lastly, I'll determine if the statement respects the listener's expertise about their own life. By asking if they've considered a strategy rather than dictating what they should do, it acknowledges the listener's personal understanding of their experiences and respects their expertise about their own life.

With all these criteria met, my conclusion is: Soft."
"You realize that if you stop smoking, you can reduce the strain on your body. ",0,"To figure out if this statement is ""Soft"" or ""Not Soft"", let's break it down according to the criteria for softness. 

1. Non-confrontational: This statement is not directly confrontational. It suggests a potential outcome (less strain on the body) if the recipient chooses to stop smoking.

2. Encourage self-exploration: It does encourage some self-exploration, as the recipient has to consider whether they want to reduce strain on their bodies and whether that desire is enough motivation to quit smoking.

3. Invitational language: The statement uses somewhat invitational language. ""You realize..."" assumes a realization on the listeners' part without being too invasive or directive.

4. Empathy and understanding: This criterion is not explicitly met because the statement does not convey clear empathy or understanding for the feelings or experiences of the person it addresses.

5. Tentative in its assertions: While it does assert that stopping smoking can lead to a reduced strain on the body, it's not overly assertive as it leaves the decision to the listener.

6. Promote the listener's autonomy: The statement allows for the listener's autonomy as it's not forcing a decision on them.

7. Respect the listener's expertise: The statement respects the listener's life expertise by assuming they realize the implications of their behaviors on their own health.

Overall this statement is quite balanced. In parts, it promotes autonomy, shows respect towards the listener's life expertise, and uses somewhat invitational language. However, it lacks clear empathy and understanding. 

Based on all the criteria, I would judge this statement to be more 'Soft' than 'Not Soft', but it could be improved by demonstrating more empathy and understanding towards the listener's situation."
Have you ever thought about how your body might feel if you were to cut down on smoking or eventually quit?,1,"Firstly, acknowledging the statement, ""Have you ever thought about how your body might feel if you were to cut down on smoking or eventually quit?"" I will dissect its softness based on the criteria provided.

This statement is non-confrontational as it is delivered as a question, hence probing instead of directly asserting and it does not involve any direct aggression. It encourages self-exploration as it invites the listener to think about the potential impacts of changing a habit on their health. The language used is invitational, asking the listener's opinion rather than demanding or dictating a course of action, hence promoting autonomy.

The statement is empathetic and understanding as it pertains to consideration about the person's health which is a genuinely caring concern. The statement is tentative in its assertions in the sense that it is not making any definite assertion about what will happen if the listener cuts down smoking or quits.

Lastly, it respects the listener's expertise about their own life by not explicitly stating that quitting smoking would be beneficial. Instead, it raises a hypothetical situation and respects the listener's opinion about how that situation might impact them. 

Hence, it can be comfortably concluded that the statement, ""Have you ever thought about how your body might feel if you were to cut down on smoking or eventually quit?"" is 'Soft'."
Social interaction makes you afraid.,0,"Firstly, let's consider the language usage here. The statement ""Social interaction makes you afraid"" is assertive, implying a known fact or an expert opinion about the person's feelings. There's no invitation for the listener to reflect or explore their feelings, but rather a direct presentation of someone else's viewpoint as the truth. 

Secondly, there's no evident empathy or understanding in this statement. It doesn't communicate that the speaker has thought about how the listener might feel or made any attempt to understand their perspective.

Thirdly, the assertiveness of the statement undermines the listener's autonomy - it tells them what their reality is, rather than asking or offering them an opportunity to share their own perspective. 

Lastly, the statement does not respect the listener's expertise about their own life - by stating that ""social interaction makes you afraid"", it assumes knowledge about the listener's inner emotional state.

From these considerations, it's clear that this statement is not aligned with the criteria of softness.

So, the judgment is: 'Not Soft'."
How do you feel about your experiences with social interaction?,1,"First, I will examine if the statement is non-confrontational. The statement is posing a question directly to the listener about their experiences, it is clear and not aggressive or argumentative in any way. It seems non-confrontational.

Next, I will consider whether it encourages self-exploration. The statement is asking about the listener's feelings and experiences, which would inherently require some reflection or introspection on the part of the listener. Therefore it could encourage self-exploration. 

Then checking if it uses invitational language, I see that the phrasing of the statement is open-ended and non-directive, it doesn't demand a specific response but instead invites the listener to share whatever they feel is relevant. So it does seem to use invitational language.

I will look for signs of empathy and understanding. The statement itself does not express empathy or understanding directly, but by asking about the listener's feelings, it implies a willingness to understand and empathize with their experiences.  

Then, determining if it’s tentative in its assertions. The statement does not make any assertions about the listener or their experiences. It simply offers them a space to discuss their feelings. 

Now, checking if it promotes the listener's autonomy. The statement leaves the decision of how to answer, and what information to share, entirely up to the listener. In this way, it respects and promotes their autonomy.

Lastly, I should see if it respects the listener's expertise about their own life. By asking the listener about their feelings and experiences, the statement acknowledges that they are the expert on their own life.

In conclusion, given that the statement ticks all the boxes for the criteria for softness, I would say this statement is 'Soft'."
You value productivity and would like to increase it by smoking less.,0,"The first step is to evaluate if the statement is non-confrontational. This statement doesn't seem to be confrontational, it is more of an acknowledgement of someone's values and desires. 

The second step is to determine if the statement encourages self-exploration with invitational language. The language utilized here does seem to invite a person to consider their relationship between their productivity and their smoking. 

Next, we must analyze whether the statement shows empathy and understanding. It acknowledges the person's value for productivity, indicating some understanding of the person's motivations. 

The fourth step is to evaluate if the statement is tentative in its assertions. The statement seems to be quite tentative, suggesting an increase in productivity may be possible if the individual smokes less, but not asserting it as a definite fact. 

The fifth factor to check is if the statement promotes the listener's autonomy. This statement does not instruct the listener to do anything, rather it proposes a change they could consider, so it appears to promote their autonomy. 

Finally, checking if the statement respects the listener's expertise about their own life is crucial. The statement acknowledges the listener's own life values and leaves the decision making to them showing respect to their lived experiences. 

In conclusion, considering all the criteria, this statement is 'Soft'."
How do you feel your productivity may change if you considered reducing your smoking habit?,1,"First, I would analyze whether the statement is non-confrontational. In this case, the statement does not force or command, but instead suggests a hypothetical situation with ""if you considered"". This respects the listener autonomy to make their own decision. 

Next I would look at, if the statement encourages self-exploration and in this case it indeed does. The question is designed to make the listener consider and reflect on the consequences of their actions with ""how do you feel your productivity may change"". 

Thirdly, I would examine if the statement promotes the listener's autonomy. Here it does, because it does not impose any views or opinions on the listener, but rather encourages them to think about their own smoking habit.

Next, I would consider whether the statement is tentative in its assertions or not. In this case it is, because it does not assert that reducing smoking will increase productivity; instead, it asks the listener to consider the possibility.

Lastly, it also respects the listener's expertise about their own life. It's encouraging them to draw from their own experiences and knowledge about their smoking habits and productivity levels. 

After analyzing all of these aspects, I conclude that the statement is 'Soft.'"
It is time to create a plan to stop drinking.,0,"This statement is assertive, not tentative. It does not demonstrate empathy or understanding, but rather, it dictates an action in a firm manner. There is no invitational language and it doesn't encourage any self-exploration. It also doesn't respect the listener's autonomy in decision-making. It assumes that it is the right time for the person to create a plan to stop drinking without considering their expertise about their own life. Therefore, it does not fulfil the criteria for softness.

The judgement is: 'Not Soft'."
Have you ever considered what your life might look like if you made a plan to reduce your drinking?,1,"Firstly, I need to establish whether the statement is non-confrontational. This statement meets this criteria as it's phrased as a question, which makes it sound less like a challenge or accusation. It simply asks the listener if they've considered a hypothetical scenario. 

Secondly, the language is invitational and encourages self-exploration. It doesn't tell the listener what to do, merely asks if they've thought about a situation. This respect for the listener's autonomy to make their own decisions is another hallmark of a 'soft' statement.

Thirdly, the statement is tentative in its assertions. It doesn't state that the listener should reduce their drinking, but instead poses a 'what if' scenario, leaving room for open-ended reflections and discussions.

Lastly, the statement respects the listener's expertise about their own life. It doesn't lay out what should happen or tell the listener what is best for them. Instead, it invites them to think about a potential plan for reducing drinking, leaving the specifics up to them. 

Based on these considerations, the statement is 'Soft'."
You want to establish a daily routine so you can smoke at your ease.,0,"To determine whether this statement is 'Soft' or 'Not Soft,' I'll examine it using the criteria provided.

1. Non-confrontational: The statement isn't aggressive or attack-like, so it meets this criterion.

2. Encourages self-exploration with invitational language: The phrase doesn't necessarily invite self-exploration or challenge the person to think deeply about their choices.

3. Shows empathy and understanding: This statement acknowledges a desire that the listener might have: to establish a routine for smoking. However, it does not demonstrate understanding, especially if the person is trying to quit. 

4. Is tentative in its assertions: The statement does not seem to be tentative. It's more of a concrete suggestion for the listener to establish a routine.

5. Promotes the listener's autonomy: It could be argued that this promotes the listener's autonomy by allowing them control over their smoking schedule, but facilitating potentially harmful habits can be a point of contention.

6. Respects the listener's expertise about their own life: This statement does seem to acknowledge that the listener knows about their own desire to smoke.

After considering all these points, it's apparent that while the statement fulfills some criteria, it fails considerably on others such as encouraging self-exploration and showing true empathy and understanding, especially if the listener is trying to quit smoking which is detrimental to their health. 

The judgment is 'Not Soft.'"
Have you considered what it might look like if you were to establish a daily routine that comfortably accommodates your smoking habits?,1,"First, I'd examine the statement for any confrontational language or tone. This statement doesn't appear to be confrontational, as it's simply posing a question instead of making an accusatory or argumentative remark. 

Second, I'd look at how the statement encourages self-exploration. The question ""have you considered"" allows the listener to reflect on a personal level regarding their habits, which promotes self-exploration.

Next, the statement uses invitational language—""what it might look like if""—which opens up the conversation for the listener's thoughts and opinions.

In terms of empathy and understanding, this statement doesn’t show explicit empathy but it does show understanding by acknowledging the listener's smoking habits.

The statement only assumes the existence of a potential routine, but it doesn't make strong assertions about what the listener should do. It gives power to the listener to decide their future actions. 

Finally, in terms of respecting the listener's expertise about their own life, the question doesn't make assumptions about the listener's experiences or choices.

Based on these observations, this statement can be considered 'Soft'."
"If you set long-term plans for your smoking habit, you will be more likely to succeed.",0,"This statement seems to give advice rather than asking or encouraging the listener to explore their own thoughts, feelings, or behaviors. It implies a certain outcome without acknowledging the listener's individual life circumstances, struggles, or expertise on their own life. The language used in the statement is fairly assertive rather than being tentative or invitational. Therefore, the statement does not promote the listener's autonomy. While the statement does not appear to be confrontational, its lack of empathy and understanding and its assertiveness make it less than soft. 

After examining the various aspects of the statement, it is clear that it lacks several key elements of softness: invitational language, empathy, tentativeness, promotion of autonomy, and respect for the listener's personal expertise. Accordingly, I would classify this statement as 'Not Soft'."
Have you thought about setting long-term plans for your smoking habits and how it might impact your success?,1,"Firstly, the language used in this statement is invitational. It is asking the listener if they have considered something, which promotes self-exploration. The statement is also non-confrontational; it is not accusing the listener of having bad habits or making bad choices. It is simply asking them to think about the impact of their actions.

Secondly, the statement is tentative since it is proposing a hypothetical situation (how the smoking habit 'might' impact success) that could motivate the listener to think critically about their habits.

Thirdly, the statement promotes the idea that the listener has the autonomy to make decisions about their own life. It shows respect for the listener's expertise about their life by putting the decision in their hands.

Fourthly, while the statement does discuss a sensitive topic, it does so in an empathetic and understanding way, rather than a harsh or judgmental one.

Based on these aspects, one could certainly identify this statement as 'Soft'."
You're don't want to break up with your partner because you're you won't find someone else.,0,"To evaluate this statement, I would start by considering if it is non-confrontational. The statement does not seem confrontational as it states an observation about the listener. However, it assumes a position of superiority, suggesting the speaker knows more about the listener's concerns and feelings than the listener does themselves, which does not respect the listener's expertise about their own life. 

Next, I would assess whether this statement encourages self-exploration. It seems not, as it provides an explanation for the listener's behavior instead of inviting them to reflect on their feelings and reasons.

Regarding empathy and understanding, it does not seem the statement is showing any genuine empathy. Instead, it is making presumptions about the listener's motivations without confirming with them whether these assumptions are true.

Examining the statement's language, it seems to lack tentativeness, instead making a definitive assertion about the listener's motivation and feelings.

Finally, this statement does not promote the listener's autonomy. Instead, it makes a claim about their actions which can feel limiting and disempowering. 

Therefore, based on these considerations, my judgment would be that this statement is 'Not Soft'."
Have you ever taken a moment to explore your feelings about the possibility of not being able to find another partner if you decide to end your current relationship?,1,"To determine if a statement is 'Soft' or 'Not Soft' involves evaluating whether it meets the known criteria. 

The statement, ""Have you ever taken a moment to explore your feelings about the possibility of not being able to find another partner if you decide to end your current relationship?"", first does not seem to be confrontational. It brings up a concern indirectly but does not force the receiver to defend their stance or feel attacked. Therefore, it's non-confrontational.

Secondly, it encourages exploration of self-feelings about a certain situation which is a component of invitational language, promoting the listener to think and respond rather than giving them instruction or information.

Also, this sentence shows empathy and understanding. The speaker acknowledges that the listener may have fear or worries about ending the relationship, thereby understanding their emotional position.

Equally, the statement is somewhat tentative. It discusses a 'possibility,' and a hypothetical situation, rather than making firm predictions or judgments about the future.

The sentence encourages the listener's autonomy by inviting them to think about their feelings and make a decision based on those feelings. This way, it respects the listener's ability to have expertise about their life and their situation.

Therefore, upon review, the statement meets all the criteria for softness. Hence, it is a 'Soft' statement."
You're finding that you drink a lot when you're alone.,0,"First, we need to check if the statement is non-confrontational. This statement seems to start from a very judgemental point of view, which can be seen as confrontational because it points out a potential issue in a direct manner rather than comforting or making the listener feel understood.
Second, consider if the statement encourages self-exploration with invitational language. It does prompt self-exploration but in a harsh way. It is not inviting the person to think on their own terms about their drinking habits, it's telling them what they are doing.
Third, think if the statement shows empathy and understanding. This statement does not demonstrate empathy or understanding, it is a blunt statement.
Fourth, identify if the statement is tentative in its assertions. This statement is quite assertive and doesn't leave any space for doubt about the speaker's position.
Fifth, establish if agreement with the statement promotes the listener's autonomy. This statement does not promote the listener's autonomy as it does not invite them to evaluate their situation or explore solutions.
Finally, confirm if the statement respects the listener's expertise about their own life. This statement doesn't leave room for the possibility that the listener knows their habits and reasons for their habits better than the speaker.

Based on all of the above, the statement 'You're finding that you drink a lot when you're alone' is 'Not Soft'."
Have you noticed how your drinking habits might change when you're by yourself?,1,"To determine whether the statement is 'soft' or 'not soft', I'll look at the individual criteria. The statement is non-confrontational. It doesn't make a direct accusation or negative assumption about the person's drinking habits. Rather, it's posed as a question, inviting the person to reflect on their own experiences and behaviors. This demonstrates the use of invitational language and encourages self-exploration. The phrase ""Have you noticed"" shows understanding and empathy, suggesting recognition that the person might have already been observing their habits. It's also tentative, as it doesn't assert that their drinking habits definitely change when alone, but asks if they've noticed it or not, respecting the person's expertise about their own life. As it encourages the listener to think about their behavior, it's promoting the listener's autonomy. 

Based on the criteria listed, the statement is 'Soft'."
You don't like thinking about smoking because you're afraid to die.,0,"The given statement seems to be asserting a belief about the listener, stating that they are afraid to die and that's why they don't like thinking about smoking. It does not leave any room for the listener's input or thoughts. It's not invitational, it doesn't show empathy or understanding to the listener's feelings, and it doesn't respect their knowledge about their own life. These all meet the criteria for a hard statement. Also, the certainty of the assumptions in the statement is not tentative, but rather definitive, which goes against this criteria for a soft statement. Therefore, this statement is 'Not Soft'."
Could it be that reflecting on your smoking habits is difficult for you because of worries about your health?,1,"In examining this statement, first, we notice its non-confrontational tone. By posing a question, it allows the listener to explore their feelings and experiences rather than accusing them or forcing them into admitting a problem. Then, it also uses invitational language - ""Could it be that..."". This phrasing encourages the listener to reflect on their experience without pushing a specific narrative onto them. The statement also shows empathy and understanding by acknowledging the fact that reflecting on smoking habits might be hard because of health worries - it validates the listener's potential fears. Furthermore, the statement is very tentative. It's not making solid assumptions about the listener, it's opening up a conversation where the listener's perspectives are of central importance. Lastly, the statement respects the listener's expertise - it implies that the listener knows best why reflecting on their smoking habits might be difficult due to the listener's unique experiences regarding their health. Given all these points, the statement clearly meets all the discussed criteria. So it's 'Soft'."
You dislike that others know that you smoke.,0,"To evaluate this statement, I will examine it based on each of the criteria for softness.

1. Non-confrontational: This statement is making an observation rather than engaging in confrontation, so it meets this criteria. 

2. Encourages self-exploration with invitational language: This statement does not invite the listener to explore their feelings or thoughts on the matter, as it already presumes certain knowledge or feelings.

3. Shows empathy and understanding: The speaker is attempting to note a feeling of discomfort in the listener by acknowledging that they dislike others knowing about their smoking habit, so it meets this point.

4. Be tentative in its assertions: This statement is not tentative. It definitively states that the listener dislikes others knowing about their smoking habit. 

5. Promotes the listener's autonomy: This statement doesn't encourage the listener's decision-making or self-governance. 

6. Respects the listener's expertise about their own life: The statement assumes to know more about the listener's feelings than the listener might have shared, which intrudes on their expertise about their own life.

Considering the above analysis, the statement is 'Not Soft' because while it meets some criteria (non-confrontational and perhaps showing empathy and understanding), it fails to meet most others by not promoting self-exploration or autonomy, being assertive rather than tentative, and not fully respecting the listener's life expertise."
How do you feel about others being aware of your smoking habit?,1,"First, I notice that the statement is not in any way accusatory or confrontational. It does not take a judgmental stance or sermonize about the subject of smoking, which signifies respect towards the listener's ability to make their own decisions regarding their lifestyle. Therefore, it fulfills the condition of promoting listener's autonomy.

Secondly, the use of ""how do you feel"" encourages self-exploration and invites the listener to express their feelings about an aspect of their life. This is in line with the criteria of using invitational language to prompt the listener to reflect on their thoughts and feelings.

Thirdly, the statement carries a sense of empathy as it is trying to understand the emotional impact of smoking on the individual's personal relationships or social image. This shows understanding and regard for the person's feelings and emotions.

Finally, the statement is tentative in its assertions, as it isn't demanding any particular action. Instead, it's a simple question that encourages the listener to express their view on a matter that pertains to their personal life - recognizing their expertise about their own life. It doesn't tell the listener what they should feel or do.

Concluding, I would state this as a 'Soft' statement. It meets all the criteria: encourages self-exploration with invitational language, shows empathy, demonstrates respect for listener's autonomy, is tentative in its assumptions, and respects the listener's understanding of their own life."
You want to stop smoking cigars altogether.,0,"To determine if the statement is 'soft' or 'not soft', I first evaluate the statement against each of the criteria for a 'soft' statement: 

1. Non-confrontational: The statement is direct, but it is not necessarily confrontational. It does not accuse or blame the listener. 

2. Encourage self-exploration with invitational language: The statement does not invite the listener to explore their thoughts or feelings about the topic. 

3. Show empathy and understanding: The statement does not offer any empathetic expressions or indicate an understanding of the listener's experiences or feelings. 

4. Be tentative in its assertions: The statement is assertive, not tentative. It assumes that the listener wants to stop smoking, rather than expressing that as a possibility. 

5. Promote the listener's autonomy: The statement doesn't necessarily infringe on the listener's autonomy, but because it assumes the listener's intent, it does not actively promote it. 

6. Respect the listener's expertise about their own life: The statement assumes the listener's desire to stop smoking, which does not respect their expertise on their own life and feelings. 

In conclusion, the statement is 'Not Soft' as it fails to meet most of the criteria for being a 'soft' statement."
Have you considered what your feelings might be about completely giving up cigar smoking?,1,"First, I'd evaluate this statement based on whether it's confrontational or not. The phrasing doesn't aggressively challenge the listener's habit of smoking cigars, so it's non-confrontational. Next, the beginning of the phrase ""Have you considered..."" invites the listener to reflect on their feelings about giving up cigar smoking, demonstrating invitational language and promoting self-exploration. 

The statement doesn't make concrete assumptions or assertions about the listener's feelings or thoughts, which makes its approach tentative. The question doesn't attempt to impose a directive or forceful course of action; instead, it asks the listener to consider their personal feelings, respecting their autonomy to make decisions. Lastly, the phrase respectfully takes into account the listener’s personal experience, implying they are the expert of their own life. 

After a careful analysis, I conclude that the statement ""Have you considered what your feelings might be about completely giving up cigar smoking?"" is 'Soft'."
You seem low-energy.,0,"Firstly, I look at the language used. The statement ""You seem low-energy"" is non-confrontational which is one of the criteria for a soft statement. There isn't any direct or harsh language used.

Next, I consider the tone of the statement. The speaker is making an observation which might be interpreted as showing empathy. However, it is not necessarily supportive or understanding. 

The statement doesn't encourage self-exploration as it doesn't promote dialog, but rather posits an observation about the listener's state of mind. 

In terms of respecting the listener's autonomy and expertise about their own life, the use of 'seem' does demonstrate tentativeness, showing that the speaker is not making a definitive judgement on the listener's energy levels. 

However, overall, it does not fulfill all the criteria for softness as it does not ask for or invite the listener's perception of their own experiences. 

In conclusion, I would judge this statement as 'Not Soft'."
How are you feeling about your energy levels these days?,1,"First, I would consider whether this statement is non-confrontational. The question is asking about the person's feelings and is not demanding or accusatory in nature. Therefore, it seems to pass this criteria. 

Next, we should check whether this question encourages self-exploration. This is a question, openly asking the person to introspect about their energy levels. It seems to invite them to reflect on their wellbeing, so it satisfies this criterion as well.

In terms of showing empathy and understanding, the question seems to show a level of concern for the individual's wellbeing, which is a form of empathy. Therefore, it can be deemed as empathetic.

With regards to the tentative nature of the statement, it's not making any assertions or conclusions. It leaves room for the person to express their own thoughts and feelings. Thus, this criterion is met too.

At then, we need to address the promotion of the listener's autonomy. The phrasing of this question places the power in the listener's hands to respond. It makes no assumptions or direction, hence it promotes autonomy.

Lastly, the listener's expertise about their own life is respected. The question recognizes that the person is the best authority of how they're feeling about their own energy levels. This criterion is also met.

After going step by step and considering all the criteria, I conclude that this statement is 'Soft'."
